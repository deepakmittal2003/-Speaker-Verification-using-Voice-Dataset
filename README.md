## Project Title: UrbanSound8K Audio Classification using Neural Networks

## Project Overview: 
The UrbanSound8K Audio Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying audio samples into predefined categories. The dataset used for this project is UrbanSound8K, which contains a diverse range of urban sounds across 10 classes, including street music, drilling, air conditioners, and more.

## Objective: 
The primary objective of this project is to build a classification system that can automatically identify the type of urban sound present in audio recordings. This system has various potential applications, including urban soundscape analysis, environmental monitoring, and urban planning.

## Project Components:

## Data Preprocessing:

Importing audio files using libraries like librosa and scipy.
Visualizing audio data to gain insights into its characteristics.
Extracting relevant features from audio samples, such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
Feature Extraction:

Utilizing MFCCs to summarize the frequency distribution across audio samples.
Extracting MFCC features for each audio file in the dataset.
## Model Development:

Building a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
Designing the architecture of the model with multiple dense layers and appropriate activation functions.
Compiling the model with suitable loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
## Model Training:

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the neural network model on the training data.
Validating the model's performance on the testing data and monitoring for overfitting.
## Model Evaluation:
Evaluating the trained model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
Assessing the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
## Testing with New Audio Data:

Demonstrating how the trained model can be used to classify new audio samples.
Preprocessing new audio data and making predictions using the trained model.
Inverse transforming predicted labels to obtain human-interpretable class names.
## Technologies Used:

Python programming language
Libraries such as librosa, scipy, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn
