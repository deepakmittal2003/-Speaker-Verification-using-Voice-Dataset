## -Speaker-Verification-using-Voice-Dataset
#### Problem Statement
Given a dataset consisting of voice recordings from multiple speakers, the objective is to develop a
deep learning model capable of accurately identifying and verifying the speaker's identity from their
voice samples. The model should effectively distinguish between different speakers and provide
reliable authentication based on their unique vocal characteristics.

#### Aim
To develop an efficient system for accurately identifying individuals based on their
voice characteristics.

#### Tools

Python 3.5 (or above) is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:
* Tensorflow 2.x
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Librosa

#### Dataset

The UrbanSound8k dataset used for model training, can be downloaded from the following [link](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).
